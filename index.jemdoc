== About me
 I will be joining the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Purdue University as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2024. My research interests lie in the optimization of networks - with application areas including multi-agent robotics, networked control, federated learning, and edge computing. More recently, I have also been working on software defined networking and next-generation wireless networks. 

 In case you're interested in working on problems at the intersection of communication networks, probabilistic modeling, optimization/control, robotics, and machine learning *I am recruiting students for Fall 2024, Spring 2025 and Fall 2025. Send me an email to get in touch!*

 I obtained a Ph.D. in the EECS department at MIT, working with [https://modiano.mit.edu Prof. Eytan Modiano] at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems ([https://lids.mit.edu LIDS]). There, I worked on the modeling, analysis and design of communication networks, with emphasis on wireless and real-time networks. I have also worked on scheduling problems in networked control systems, robotics, federated learning, and software defined network control for datacenters.

 Priot to my time at MIT, I received a B.Tech. with Honors in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay ([http://www.iitb.ac.in IIT-B]). There, I worked with [https://sites.google.com/site/sharayumoharir/ Prof. Sharayu Moharir] on resource allocation in wireless networks.

== Recent Updates

*Jun 2024*: After a wonderful year at Google, I will be moving to the ECE department at Purdue as an /Elmore Scholar of Excellence/ Assistant Professor.

*Dec 2023*: Our paper "Monitoring Correlated Sources: AoI-based Scheduling is Nearly Optimal" just got accepted to [https://infocom2024.ieee-infocom.org/program/accepted-paper-list-main-conference IEEE INFOCOM 2024]. This was joint work with R. Vallabh Ramakanth and Prof. Modiano.

*Dec 2023*: My thesis and ongoing research will be profiled in the upcoming special issue of the ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Review. You can find a copy of the profile [https://www.mit.edu/~vishrant/ACM_Profile.pdf here].

*Aug 2023*: I recently defended my Ph.D. thesis successfully at MIT. This was a culmination of 6 years of work, and I am grateful to everyone who helped me along the way! You can find a video recording of my defense [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRHrGnG0qDY here] and a pdf version of the slides I used during my defense [https://www.mit.edu/~vishrant/Thesis_Defense_shortened.pdf here].

== Research
My research interests include 
- Communication Networks
- Robotics
- Control & Optimization

I currently work on designing scheduling policies for the consistent delivery of timely information in wireless and mobile networks. Applications include internet-of-things, networked control systems, multi-agent robotics and federated learning.

My work typically involves formulating a theoretical model that captures the main details of a problem to be studied, but still remains analytically tractable. Then, I analyze this model to gain new insights; using tools from probability, optimization and algorithms. More recently, I have also been interested in building new wireless systems that verify our fundamental theoretical results in practice. A short video describing some of this work is linked below -
