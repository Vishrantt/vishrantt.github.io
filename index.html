<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I will be joining the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Purdue University as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2024. My research interests lie in the optimization of networks - with application areas including multi-agent robotics, networked control, federated learning, and edge computing. More recently, I have also been working on software defined networking and next-generation wireless networks. </p>
<p>In case you're interested in working on problems at the intersection of communication networks, probabilistic modeling, optimization/control, robotics, and machine learning <strong>I am recruiting students for Fall 2024, Spring 2025 and Fall 2025. Send me an email to get in touch!</strong></p>
<p>I obtained a Ph.D. in the EECS department at MIT, working with <a href="https://modiano.mit.edu"  >Prof. Eytan Modiano</a> at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (<a href="https://lids.mit.edu"  >LIDS</a>). There, I worked on the modeling, analysis and design of communication networks, with emphasis on wireless and real-time networks. I have also worked on scheduling problems in networked control systems, robotics, federated learning, and software defined network control for datacenters.</p>
<p>Priot to my time at MIT, I received a B.Tech. with Honors in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (<a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in"  >IIT-B</a>). There, I worked with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sharayumoharir/"  >Prof. Sharayu Moharir</a> on resource allocation in wireless networks.</p>

<h2>Recent Updates</h2>
<p><strong>Jun 2024</strong>: After a wonderful year at Google, I will be moving to the ECE department at Purdue as an <em>Elmore Scholar of Excellence</em> Assistant Professor.</p>
<p><strong>Dec 2023</strong>: Our paper &ldquo;Monitoring Correlated Sources: AoI-based Scheduling is Nearly Optimal&rdquo; just got accepted to <a href="https://infocom2024.ieee-infocom.org/program/accepted-paper-list-main-conference"  >IEEE INFOCOM 2024</a>. This was joint work with R. Vallabh Ramakanth and Prof. Modiano.</p>
<p><strong>Dec 2023</strong>: My thesis and ongoing research will be profiled in the upcoming special issue of the ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Review. You can find a copy of the profile <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~vishrant/ACM_Profile.pdf"  >here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Aug 2023</strong>: I recently defended my Ph.D. thesis successfully at MIT. This was a culmination of 6 years of work, and I am grateful to everyone who helped me along the way! You can find a video recording of my defense <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRHrGnG0qDY"  >here</a> and a pdf version of the slides I used during my defense <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~vishrant/Thesis_Defense_shortened.pdf"  >here</a>. You can also find a copy of my thesis <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~vishrant/tripathi-vishrant-phd-2023-thesis.pdf"  >here</a>.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>My research interests include </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Communication Networks</p>
</li>
<li><p>Robotics</p>
</li>
<li><p>Control &amp; Optimization</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I currently work on designing scheduling policies for the consistent delivery of timely information in wireless and mobile networks. Applications include internet-of-things, networked control systems, multi-agent robotics and federated learning.</p>
<p>My work typically involves formulating a theoretical model that captures the main details of a problem to be studied, but still remains analytically tractable. Then, I analyze this model to gain new insights; using tools from probability, optimization and algorithms. More recently, I have also been interested in building new wireless systems that verify our fundamental theoretical results in practice. A short video describing some of this work is linked below - </p>
