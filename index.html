<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I joined the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Purdue University as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2024. Here, I have set up the <a href="https://vishrantt.github.io/main-lab"><b>Multi-Agent Intelligent Networks (MAIN)</b> group</a>. Our research interests lie in the optimization of networks - with application areas including multi-agent robotics, networked control, federated learning, and edge computing. More recently, I have also been working on software defined networking and next-generation wireless networks. </p>
<p>In case you're interested in working on problems at the intersection of communication networks, probabilistic modeling, optimization/control, robotics, and machine learning <b>I am recruiting students for Spring 2025 and Fall 2025. Send me an email to get in touch!</b></p>
<p>I obtained a Ph.D. in the EECS department at MIT, working with <a href="https://modiano.mit.edu">Prof. Eytan Modiano</a> at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (<a href="https://lids.mit.edu">LIDS</a>). There, I worked on the modeling, analysis and design of communication networks, with emphasis on wireless and real-time networks. I have also worked on scheduling problems in networked control systems, robotics, federated learning, and software defined network control for datacenters.</p>
<p>Priot to my time at MIT, I received a B.Tech. with Honors in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (<a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in">IIT-B</a>). There, I worked with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sharayumoharir/">Prof. Sharayu Moharir</a> on resource allocation in wireless networks.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>For a detailed description of my current research interests, please check our group's website - <a href="https://vishrantt.github.io/main-lab">MAIN lab</a>. </p>
<p>At a high level, my research interests include </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Communication Networks</p>
</li>
<li><p>Robotics</p>
</li>
<li><p>Control &amp; Optimization</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I currently work on designing scheduling policies for the consistent delivery of timely information in wireless and mobile networks. Applications include internet-of-things, networked control systems, multi-agent robotics and federated learning.</p>
<p>My work typically involves formulating a theoretical model that captures the main details of a problem to be studied, but still remains analytically tractable. Then, I analyze this model to gain new insights; using tools from probability, optimization and algorithms. More recently, I have also been interested in building new wireless systems that verify our fundamental theoretical results in practice. A short video describing some of this work is linked below - </p>

<p>I defended my Ph.D. thesis successfully at MIT in Aug 2023. This was a culmination of 6 years of work, and I am grateful to everyone who helped me along the way! You can find a video recording of my defense <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRHrGnG0qDY">here</a> and a pdf version of the slides I used during my defense <a href="https://vishrantt.github.io/Thesis_Defense_shortened.pdf">here</a>.
