==Research

My research is on the modeling, analysis and design of communication networks, with emphasis on wireless and real-time networks. My current focus is on scheduling problems in networked control systems, robotics and federated learning.

I am generally interested in scheduling and resource allocation problems, even those arising outside wireless networks, and I have experience working on these problems at scale in Google and Facebook.

While most of my work tends to be theoretical, over the past two years I have also designed and built new wireless systems that implement some of my network algorithms on drones and small autonomous vehicles, in collaboration with [http://www.mit.edu/~kadota/ Igor Kadota] and [https://www.ezratal.net/ Ezra Tal]. You can find a video describing some of this work [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGjGxK5AXFk here].

Some other stuff that I have worked on over the years includes predicting chaotic systems using matrix estimation (course project for advanced machine learning at MIT), non-monotonic Lyapunov functions (course project for algebraic optimization at MIT), finding large submatrices in random matrices (course project for advanced probability at MIT), and distributed spectral clustering (course project for advanced signal processing at IIT-B).
